# Agent Path Matrix

Reference: Framework capability matrix for Spec Kitty 2.0.11+

## Skill Roots and Wrapper Roots by Agent

Canonical Spec Kitty doctrine skills are now managed in the user's home
directory and projected into project roots as needed. That means a CLI upgrade
refreshes the canonical pack once under the user home; projects should not need
fresh per-repo snapshots of `spec-kitty-*` skills.

## Installation Classes

### native-root-required

Agents in this class require skills to be placed under their own directory tree.
They do not read from the shared `.agents/skills/` root.

**Agents:** Claude Code, Qwen Code, Kilo Code

### shared-root-capable

Agents in this class can read skills from the shared `.agents/skills/` root in
addition to their agent-specific skill root. When both exist, the agent-specific
root takes precedence.

**Agents:** GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI, Cursor, opencode, Windsurf, Codex CLI,
Mistral Vibe, Pi, Letta Code, Auggie CLI, Roo Code, Kiro CLI, Google Antigravity

### wrapper-only

Agents in this class do not support a skill root directory. Skills are delivered
exclusively through wrapper slash commands in the wrapper root.

**Agents:** Amazon Q Developer CLI

## Notes

- The shared root `.agents/skills/` is created once and symlinked or referenced
  by all shared-root-capable agents. The canonical managed copy lives in
  `~/.agents/skills/`; project roots should project to it rather than snapshot it.
- Managed canonical files under the user home are read-only. If a project replaces
  one of its projected files locally, that is treated as drift and can be repaired.
- Wrapper roots contain slash-command files (e.g., `spec-kitty.implement.md`)
  that agents use for `/spec-kitty.implement` style invocation.
- When verifying an installation, check the skill root(s) first, then the
  wrapper root. A missing wrapper root means slash commands are unavailable
  even if skills are correctly installed.
