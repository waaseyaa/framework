# spk-gate-accept

Use this skill when runtime reaches terminal state, the user asks to accept a
mission, or all WPs appear complete.

## Flow

1. Run `/spec-kitty.accept` or the equivalent CLI command.
2. Confirm all required WPs are approved or done.
3. Verify required tests, artifacts, and mission invariants.
4. If accept fails, route to `spk-run-blocked-recovery`.
5. If accept passes, route to `spk-gate-merge`.

## Rule

Accept is not a formality. It is the final pre-merge readiness gate.
