# spk-doctrine-semantic-compression

Use this skill when the user asks to reduce, simplify, deduplicate, delete dead
code, or refactor while preserving existing behavior.

## Flow

1. Load agent profile `randy-reducer`.
2. Load paradigm `semantic-compression`.
3. Map the behavioral envelope before editing.
4. Find exact, parameterized, structural, and semantic redundancy.
5. Extract one implementation per concept or delete proven dead weight.
6. Consolidate competing behavioral paths behind one canonical owner.
7. Verify equivalence and report evidence plus residual risk.

## Stop Conditions

- Protected behavior is unknown.
- Verification evidence is unavailable for non-trivial deletion.
- The request is actually feature expansion, not reduction.
